Exercise 14: cp -u *.html .. Copy all html files from the current directory to the parent directory, but only copy files that didn't exist in the parent directory or are newer versions than the ones that already exist in the parent directory. The -u option didn't show on the terminal manual page. The -u option copies the file into the directory if its a newer version. If the file doesn't exist in the directory, it will copy over. The -n option works for copying files that don't exist in the parent directory, but it doesn't check if the file is a newer version or not.

The listing should be alph ordered, except for dot (.) or dot dot (..), which should be listed at the beginning. The -a option is to show any hidden files. The -p option writes a / at the end of directory names. The -m option streams the output, separating each listing with commas.
